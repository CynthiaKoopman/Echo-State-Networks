# EchoStateNetworks - Reservoir Computing
Implementation of Echo State Networks, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks.

This rep includes:
* Simple ESN on sawtooth data
* Simple parameter search for simple ESN

Echo state networks work with a large reservoir instead of multiple layers in RNN. Echo state networks have shown to perform faster and easier to compute then most RNN variants, such as LSTMs, whilst resulting in better performance.
